# Data Loading Pipeline

## {doc}`torch.utlis.data <pytorch:data>` Package

PyTorch's data package plays a crucial role in deep learning pipelines, with
three foundational classes at its core: [Dataset]{.pcls},
[IterableDataset]{.pcls}, and [DataLoader]{.pcls}. The Dataset class
supports both [map-style]{.wpg} and [iterable-style]{.wpg} datasets, while
the DataLoader efficiently handles the complex tasks of data loading,
sampling, batching, and data feeding. For map-style datasets, custom
[Sampler]{.pcls}s can be used to meet specific needs. IterableDataset is
particularly valuable for dealing with data that exceeds available memory or
requires computationally expensive loading. This class allows data to be
processed and streamed in an iterative manner.Furthermore, PyTorch's
DataLoader is adept at handling asynchronous and multiprocessing workflows,
enhancing data loading performance through configurable parameters such as
num_workers, pin_memory, and multiprocessing, all tailored to specific
hardware and data loading requirements.

1. [Dataset]{.pcls}: Map-Style Dataset Subclass
    
    * [\_\_init\_\_()]{.pfxn}: Required
        
        * Load the entire data into the dataset when it is constructed.
        * The entire dataset must be able to be loaded into memory and processed
          by the CPU without exceeding the limits.
        * It is not suitable for streaming data.
    
    * [\_\_getitem\_\_()]{.pfxn}: Required
        
        * Map-style fetching method using integer or string keys.
        * If using string keys, a custom Sampler must be supplied.
    
    * [\_\_len\_\_()]{.pfxn}: Optional
        
        * To sample the data, the Sampler needs this method to get the size of
          the dataset.
        * A custom Sampler that iterates over the dataset without using
          this method can only be used to fetch the data one by one and
          wait for the next one if it is not loading already. This can be useful
          for certain applications, such as streaming data. However, it is not
          generally recommended for sampling, as it is inefficient and does not
          allow you to use PyTorch's built-in sampling features.
        * Using the IterableDataset class is the best way to deal with streaming
          data
        * This method is optional for Dataset subclasses, but it is required
          for most Map-Style Datasets.
    
    * [\_\_getitems\_\_()]{.pfxn}: Optional
        
        * This method is optional. It can speed up data loading for
          sampling and batching.
        * A batch of samples can be fetched using a list of integer or
          string keys.

2. [DataLoader]{.pcls}
    
    * [\_\_init\_\_()]{.pfxn}: Constructor
        
        * Setup dataset, sampler, batching size and more.
        * If there is no custom Sampler or built-in Sampler setup, the built-in
          sampler will be used over the dataset in a sequential order, without
          shuffling.
    
    * [\_\_iter\_\_()]{.pfxn}: Iterator
        
        * Iterate over the Sampler to load the data in batches.
        * This is the feeding method for models.

3. [Sampler]{.pcls}: Optional Subclass
    
    * [\_\_init\_\_()]{.pfxn}: Optional
        
        * Setup dataset and get the size of the dataset.
    
    * [\_\_iter_\_()]{.pfxn}: Required
        
        * Custom sampling strategy and fetch the samples from dataset.
        * Custom multi-workers processing is used here to speed up data loading.
          However, the overall memory usage is the number of workers multiplied
          by the size of the parent process. Therefore, be careful of memory
          usage when loading a lot of data into the dataset.
    
    * If a built-in sampler has been set up and passed to Dataloader,
      Dataloader iterates sampler's \_\_iter\_\_() method to fetch the samples.

    * [\_\_init\_\_()]{.pfxn}: Optional
    * [\_\_iter\_\_()]{.pfxn}: Required
        
        * For data that cannot be loaded into memory all at once, such as
          streaming data, large data, or CPU-intensive data, use this method
          to manage the data loading process.
        * Custom multi-workers processing is used here to speed up data loading.
        * Build your own strategy to split the original data into parts, control
          the data loading speed, and adapt the batching to the feeding process
          speed.
        * Develop your own sampling strategy to load the different parts of the
          data from multiple workers.
